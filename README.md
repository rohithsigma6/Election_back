# Election App Backend

Welcome to the backend repository of our Election App! This backend application is responsible for managing election-related data, user authentication, and API endpoints for our election management system.

## Features

- **Authentication:** Secure user registration and login with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for access control.
- **API Endpoints:** Create, read, update, and delete candidates, voters, and election data.
- **Database:** MongoDB is used as our database to store election-related information.
- **Security:** Implement input validation, authorization checks, and other security best practices.
- **Testing:** Unit tests and integration tests ensure the reliability of the backend.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed.
- MongoDB database server running.
- Configuration of environment variables for sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, JWT secret).
